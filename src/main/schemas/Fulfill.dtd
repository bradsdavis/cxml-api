    Common to most variants of the PunchOut transaction set.  Defined here
    to be easily shared between multiple DTD files without requiring
    inclusion of Transaction.mod in all of them.

    All of the PunchOut transaction sets include an originating Request
    (ProviderSetupRequest for example), relatively simple Response
    (PunchOutSetupResponse for example) and final Message
    (ProviderDoneMessage or PunchOutOrderMessage).  The Request and
    Response comprise a back-end transaction between two cooperating
    applications that wish to extend an interactive session from one to the
    other.  The Request provides the destination application with
    authentication, identification and other setup information.  The
    Response provides the originating application with a unique starting
    location for the interactive (HTML) session at the destination system.

    After receiving a Response of this type, the originating application
    redirects the user's browser to the provided location.  (For some
    non-HTML applications, opening a new browser window at that location
    may be more appropriate.)  The destination system eventually provides
    an HTML form to the user's browser.  This form submits the final
    Message to close the remote session, return that user to the
    originating application and carry any required information back to the
    originating application.

    OriginatorCookie - Identification of a specific PunchOut session.  Used

    SupplierBatch is the batch ID provided by the supplier at the line item quantity level

-->
<!ELEMENT SupplierBatchID (#PCDATA)>


<!--
    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.


    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document.  Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections.  This would appear as:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities.  This might be a bit harder for humans to read.  For example:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

    revisionID     
       Also known as Material Revision Level. "Revision" is the most widely-used
       term for referring to that attribute which distinguishes one closely-
       related design iteration from another. A revision represents a change to
       an object, or a modification to a part such that the part remains
       interchangeable with its previous iteration.
       As part of engineering change management the supplier uses the revision
       level to uniquely identify the version of a product, of an article or of
       a part.

	Date the order is no longer available. If not defined, end date is open
	ended. Currently only used with blanket orders.
    agreementID
        Identifies associated agreement corresponding to the Release Order.
	At an implementation level it has to be validated that if the orderType
	is 'release' then the appropriate agreementID is also provided.
    agreementPayloadID
        Optional PayloadID for the corresponding Master Agreement.

    parentAgreementID
	Used only in the context of a Order of type "blanket". This identifies the

    described at all, each mode of a multi-modal route must be described by
    a separate Route element.  It is not necessary to describe every leg of
    the journey to the buyer's ShipTo location.

    The only Contact roles likely to be sensible in this element are
    "carrierCorporate" (details the contact information the supplier has
    about the carrier organization), "shipFrom" and "shipTo".  The
    "carrierCorporate" role would be relevant at this level only when a

<!--
    Request to add confirmation information to the data known about an
    order at the receiving server.

    While multiple confirmations may be sent for one order, each
    confirmation must mention a line item once.  And, a line item must not
    be mentioned in more than one confirmation.  Multiple confirmations are
    allowed (and sensible) only when each has type="allDetail" or
    type="detail".  Only one (original) confirmation per order of
    type="accept", type="except" or type="reject" is allowed.  When a
    confirmation with one of these types arrives, the receiving system must
    discard any and all previous confirmations for the order.

    OrderStatusRequestReference or OrderStatusRequestIDInfo can be optionally added to
    explicitly reference to the Order Status Request that originated the confirmation.

    ConfirmationItem elements may appear in any order within the
    ConfirmationRequest.  Of course, an easily-readable order such as by
    increasing lineNumber value is preferred.  Again, no line item
    (Confirmation@lineNumber attribute value) may appear more than once
    within a ConfirmationRequest element.
-->
<!ELEMENT ConfirmationRequest
    (ConfirmationHeader, OrderReference, (OrderStatusRequestReference | OrderStatusRequestIDInfo)*, ConfirmationItem*)>

<!--
    Information about this confirmation that's common to all contained
    items.

    The contained DocumentReference element may appear in a document only
    when the operation is "update".  In that case, the DocumentReference is
    required and it must reference the most recent ConfirmationRequest
    document for this particular confirmation (usually also indicated by a
    common confirmID).  For example when a confirmation is created, updated
    and then updated again, the final document must contain a
    DocumentReference referring to the previous ConfirmationRequest with
    operation="update".  That document must, in turn, refer to the original
    (operation="new") ConfirmationRequest document.

    Tax and Shipping amounts may be updated (included in the confirmation
    with new values) without corresponding line item information
    (additional information in the ConfirmationItem list).  Total should
    not be included with a different value from the OrderRequest document
    unless a ConfirmationItem describes a new UnitPrice or quantity.  It is
    not necessary to copy this information from the OrderRequest document:
    Total, Tax and Shipping should not be included if they match those
    amounts in the original order.

    Contact roles may usefully include: technicalSupport, customerService,
    sales, shipFrom (starting point for shipments related to this order),
    shipTo (echoing the ShipTo element from the OrderRequest document),
    payTo (where payment for this order should be sent), billTo (echoing
    the BillTo element from the OrderRequest document), buyerCorporate
    (details the supplier has about the buying organization) and
    supplierCorporate.  It is not necessary to copy this information from
    the OrderRequest document: The Contact element should be used primarily
    to add information to that known about an order or to describe the
    sender of this particular confirmation.

    Elements in the Contact list may appear in any order.  A contact role
    (Contact@role attribute value) must not appear more than once within a
    ConfirmationHeader element.

    Elements in the Hazard list may appear in any order.  The same hazard
    should not be listed more than once in a ConfirmationHeader.  Each
    hazard listed at this level (in a ConfirmationHeader element) should
    apply to the entire order or all items mentioned in this confirmation.
    A ConfirmationRequest which updates the status of a single line item
    should not include Hazard elements in the ConfirmationItem element.

    The Comments element list may contain additional information about the
    status of the overall order (or the portion described in this
    confirmation) such as payment terms, additional detail on shipping
    terms and clarifications of the status.  For the last type of
    information, terms such as "backordered", "shipped" and "invalid" may
    be sensible.  All such data must be intended for human use.  The text
    in this list should describe this particular confirmation and not
    repeat Comments appearing in the OrderRequest.

    Elements in the Comments list may appear in any order.  The xml:lang
    attribute may have the same value in multiple Comments elements in the
    list.  The set of Comments with a particular xml:lang value should
    contain similar content to that for any other xml:lang value present in
    the list.

    On the other hand, the Extrinsic element list may be used to insert
    additional data about the order for application consumption.  These
    elements may include pre-defined keywords and values affecting workflow
    in the receiving system.

    Elements in the Extrinsic list may appear in any order.  An extrinsic
    type (Extrinsic@name attribute value) must not appear more than once
    within a ConfirmationHeader element.  A type may not be mentioned both
    in this list and in a particular ConfirmationStatus element.  (The
    ConfirmationHeader must not contain a default extrinsic value
    overridden at the lower level.)

    confirmID
        An (optional) identifier for this particular confirmation assigned
        by the supplier.  A user-visible and secondary (to the payloadID
        attribute of the cXML element) identifier for this document.  This
        value does not vary as a particular confirmation is updated.  That
        is, operation="update" documents describing the status of the same
        items in the same order would share a confirmID with the original
        operation="new" ConfirmationRequest.

        When the confirmID does not appear in an operation="new"
        ConfirmationRequest, it must not appear in a corresponding
        operation="update" document.  Links between these documents must be
        deduced using the DocumentReference element contained in the
        update's ConfirmationHeader and the payloadID attribute of the
        original or previous update.
    operation
        The (optional) operational mode of the confirmation document.
        Defaults to "new".

        An "update" confirmation allows a supplier to correct an error in a
        confirmation or to add additional information learned later.  In
        either case, an "update" document must be complete: All data from
        the original confirmation or a previous update should be discarded
        by the recipient.  A ConfirmationRequest document does not provide
        default data for a subsequent operation="update" document.  (This
        applies in particular to Hazard and Extrinsic elements, which
        should appear at either the header or item levels but not both.)

        The "completeness" requirement allows the information contained in
        a ConfirmationRequest to expand.  No restrictions are placed on
        including additional items that have not yet been referenced in a
        ConfirmationRequest in a operation="update" ConfirmationRequest.
        However, added items must not have been mentioned in another
        ConfirmationRequest unless all items from that (other) confirmation
        are now described in the consolidated document.  This protocol
        supports neither splitting confirmations (sending an
        operation="update" ConfirmationRequest document describing a subset
        of the items in an earlier version) nor partial consolidations of
        confirmations (sending an operation="update" ConfirmationRequest
        document that contains a subset of the information from another
        confirmation).

        An operation="update" ConfirmationRequest must contain the same
        confirmID (if any) as the previous version of the confirmation.
        When included, this attribute provides an unambiguous and direct
        connection between all versions of the confirmation.

        An operation="update" ConfirmationRequest must also include a
        DocumentReference element in the ConfirmationHeader.  (See above
        for more information on this element.)  This effectively sequences
        multiple versions of a confirmation and may provide the only link
        between those versions.  (See above under confirmID for more on the
        implications of leaving out that attribute.)  Other confirmations
        discarded through consolidations as described above are not
        explicitly referenced by the new, larger ConfirmationRequest
        document.

        A confirmation may not be deleted; the protocol does not include an
        operation="delete" option for this request.  Suppliers must replace
        incorrect or invalid confirmations with correct information.  A
        type="unknown" ConfirmationStatus will reset such information to
        its original state.  This covers the case of an error in accepting
        or rejecting an item that has not been researched.
    type
        The type of confirmation:
        accept
            The entire order is accepted as described in the referenced
            OrderRequest document.

            A document of this type may contain ConfirmationItem elements.
            If ConfirmationItem elements are present in the
            ConfirmationRequest document, they must contain only
            ConfirmationStatus elements of type="accept".
        allDetail
            This confirmation updates only those line items described in
            the following ConfirmationItem elements.  Line items not
            mentioned specifically in this document retain their current
            status.  Unlike the "detail" type (below), a confirmation of
            this type includes all information known by the supplier,
            whether or not it differs from the data provided in the
            original OrderRequest document.

            This type is provided for compatibility with current EDI and
            order entry tools (which commonly send the buyer a snapshot of
            an order in the supplier's systems).  Due to the reconciliation
            issues caused by confirmations of this type, it is recommended
            that use of this type be considered a "bridge" strategy
            suitable only for the short term.

            A document of this type must contain ConfirmationItem elements.
            The contained ConfirmationStatus elements must have types
            "allDetail", "reject" or "unknown".  "accept" , "detail" 
            or "backordered". status types are not allowed because they 
            conflict with the requirements of this document type.
        detail
            This confirmation updates only those line items described in
            the following ConfirmationItem elements.  Line items not
            mentioned specifically in this document retain their current
            states.  A confirmation of this type should include only
            information which differs from that in the original
            OrderRequest document.

            Later ConfirmationRequest documents that restore information
            provided in the OrderRequest should not include the variations
            described in an earlier ConfirmationRequest.  For example, the
            Tax element may appear in a ConfirmationStatus of one
            ConfirmationRequest and not in an update to that confirmation.
            This signifies that the original OrderRequest actually
            contained the correct charge.

            A document of this type must contain ConfirmationItem elements.
            The contained ConfirmationStatus elements may have any type
            except "allDetail".

        backordered
            The entire order is backordered.

            A document of this type may contain ConfirmationItem elements.
            If ConfirmationItem elements are present in the
            ConfirmationRequest document, they must contain only
            ConfirmationStatus elements of type="backordered".

        except
            The entire order is accepted as described in the referenced
            OrderRequest document with exceptions listed in the following
            ConfirmationItem elements.  Line items not mentioned
            specifically in this document are accepted without change.

            A document of this type must contain ConfirmationItem elements.
            The contained ConfirmationStatus elements may have any type
            except "allDetail".
        reject
            The entire order is rejected.  No further (line item) detail is
            provided beyond the reason described in the Comments element.

            A document of this type must not contain ConfirmationItem
            elements.

        requestToPay
            This type of confirmation is for the supplier to request the
            initiation of payment transactions for either the whole
            order or some line items.

            If the request contains no ConfirmationItem elements, the intent
            will be to initiate payment transaction on the total amount of
            all line items in the order, except those being rejected.

            If the request contains ConfirmationItem elements, payment
            transaction will be initiated against the specified items and
            quantities.

            A ConfirmationItem in this type of request does not have to
            describe the complete line item. It should only contain
            "requestToPay" ConfirmationStatus elements for new payment
            transactions.

        replace
            The entire order is replaced.  This is used by supplier to
            perform a wholesale replacement of the order.  In the case
            that a changed order is sent from Buyer before this
            OrderConfirmation is received by Buyer, Supplier should
            accept the new changed order.  ConfirmationItems in this
            type of request must contain ConfirmationStatus elements
            only of type "detail", and each ConfirmationStatus element
            must include an ItemIn element.

    noticeDate
        The date and time this confirmation was created.
    invoiceID
        An optional supplier-generated identifier for an Invoice associated
        with the items described in this confirmation.  Identical to the
        Invoice Number which appears at the top of a physical Invoice.
    incoTerms
        Optional shipping terms as defined by the International Chamber of
        Commerce.  These terms inform the buyer which portion of the
        shipping charges are their responsibility.  Allowed values include:
            cfr - Cost and freight
            cif - Cost, insurance and freight
            cip - Carriage and insurance paid to
            cpt - Carriage paid to
            daf - Delivered at frontier
            ddp - Delivered duty paid
            ddu - Delivered duty unpaid
            deq - Delivered ex quay (duty paid)
            des - Delivered ex ship
            exw - Ex works
            fas - Free alongside ship
            fca - Free carrier
            fob - Free on board vessel
    version
        The version number for this confirmation. It should start with 1 and
        should be incremented by 1 for each subsequent version (2,3,4...).

<!--
    Information about a specific line item.  Must completely describe the
    status of the referenced line item.  For example, two
    ConfirmationRequest documents may be necessary to update the status of
    an entire order.  However, a particular item must be mentioned in only
    one of these documents.

    A particular line item from an order must not be mentioned in more than
    one ConfirmationItem element.

    Any Contact elements provided at this level describe contacts specific
    to this item.  The ConfirmationHeader description mentions roles
    appropriate at this level as well.  A particular Contact role must not
    appear in both the ConfirmationItem and ConfirmationHeader elements.

    Elements in the Contact list may appear in any order.  A contact role
    (Contact@role attribute value) must not appear more than once within a
    ConfirmationItem element.

    Elements in the Hazard list may appear in any order.  The same hazard
    should not be listed more than once in a ConfirmationItem.  Each hazard
    listed at this level (in a ConfirmationItem element) must apply to the
    this specific line item.  A ConfirmationRequest which updates the
    status of a single line item should not include Hazard elements in the
    ConfirmationItem element.

    The list of ConfirmationStatus elements may appear in any order.
    However, the described quantities must sum to the quantity of the
    containing ConfirmationItem element (after any conversions required by
    use of different UnitOfMeasure scales at each level).  This ensures the
    status of a particular line item is completely described in a
    ConfirmationRequest document.

    quantity
        Number of this line item which was ordered.  Expressed in the units
        given in the UnitOfMeasure element.  Copied directly from the
        corresponding line item (ItemOut) in the document referenced in the
        OrderReference element.
    lineNumber
        Position (counting from 1) of this item in an order.  Copied
        directly from the corresponding line item (ItemOut) in the document
        referenced in the sibling OrderReference element.
    parentLineNumber
        lineNumber of the parent line item in the order confirmation request.

<!--
    Confirmation status of a specific line item or portion thereof.
    Quantities at this level must sum to that in the containing
    ConfirmationItem.  Documents should use a consistent UnitOfMeasure in
    ConfirmationItem and contained ConfirmationStatus elements.  A
    substitution (replacement item) may use a different UnitOfMeasure in
    the ItemDetail contained within the ItemIn element.

    In the normal case (for simple acceptance or rejection of this item),
    the ConfirmationStatus element would contain only a UnitOfMeasure
    element and the quantity and type attributes.  ItemIn appears in this
    element if and only if the supplier is recommending a substitution or
    the type is "allDetail".  In that case, the quantity of the ItemIn
    element must match that of the containing ConfirmationStatus unless the
    UnitOfMeasure is different.  ItemDetail must appear inside ItemIn
    whenever ItemIn appears in this context.  That is, an ItemIn element in
    a ConfirmationStatus element must contain an ItemDetail element.

    UnitPrice, Tax and Shipping amounts may be updated (included in the
    ConfirmationStatus element with new values) without a complete part
    substitution.  It is not necessary to copy this information from the
    OrderRequest document: UnitPrice, Tax and Shipping should not be
    included if they match that in the original ItemOut element.  The
    addition of tax or shipping amounts not mentioned in the original order
    may appear when the type is "accept", "allDetail" or "detail".  The
    "accept" type should be used if these additions are the only changes
    from the order.  The "detail" type implies a substitution (presence of
    the ItemIn element), price change (presence of the UnitPrice element)
    or delayed shipment (presence of the deliveryDate attribute).
    Unfortunately, the "allDetail" type requires reconciliation software to
    determine what has changed since the original order.

    The Comments element list may contain additional information about the
    status of this portion of the item such clarifications of the type
    attribute.  Terms such as "backordered", "shipped" and "invalid" may be
    sensible.  All such data must be intended for human use.

    Elements in the Comments list may appear in any order.  The xml:lang
    attribute may have the same value in multiple Comments elements in the
    list.  The set of Comments with a particular xml:lang value should
    contain similar content to that for any other xml:lang value present in
    the list.

    On the other hand, the Extrinsic element list may be used to insert
    additional data about this particular item portion for application
    consumption.  These elements may include pre-defined keywords and
    values affecting workflow in the receiving system.

    Elements in the Extrinsic list may appear in any order.  An extrinsic
    type (Extrinsic@name attribute value) must not appear more than once
    within a ConfirmationStatus element.  A type may not be mentioned both
    in this list and in the overall ConfirmationHeader element.  (The
    ConfirmationHeader must not contain a default extrinsic value
    overridden at this lower level.)

    SupplierBatchID
        SupplierBatch is the batch ID provided by the supplier at the line item quantity level
        to identify  the batch in which the item or the product was produced. The batch id is helpful in tracebility.
        Batch numbers (also call "lot number", "variant") are used in several industries to uniquely identify  items produced together.

    quantity
        Number of this line item which has this status.  Expressed in the
        units given in the UnitOfMeasure element.
    type
        The status of this particular portion of the order:
        accept
            This portion of the line item is accepted as described in the
            referenced ItemOut element.

            This type is allowed in documents with overall
            (ConfirmationHeader) types "accept", "detail" or "except".
        allDetail
            This portion of the line item is accepted as detailed in the
            contents of this ConfirmationStatus element.  These contents
            completely describe what will be shipped.  Unlike the "detail"
            type (below), a confirmation of this type includes all
            information known by the supplier, whether or not it differs
            from the data provided in the original OrderRequest document.

            This type is provided for compatibility with current EDI and
            order entry tools (which commonly send the buyer a snapshot of
            an order in the supplier's systems).  Due to the reconciliation
            issues caused by confirmations of this type, it is recommended
            that use of this type be considered a "bridge" strategy
            suitable only for the short term.

            This type is allowed only in documents with overall
            (ConfirmationHeader) type "allDetail".
        detail
            This portion of the line item is accepted with the changes
            detailed in the contents of this ConfirmationStatus element.
            At least one of the UnitPrice, Shipping, Tax or ItemIn elements
            or the deliveryDate attribute must be present.

            This type is allowed in documents with overall
            (ConfirmationHeader) types "detail", "except" or "replace".

        backordered
            This portion of the line item is backordered.

            This type is allowed in documents with overall
            (ConfirmationHeader) types "backordered", "detail" ,"except",
            and "allDetail". "shipmentDate" and "deliveryDate" attributes for 
            this type of ConfirmationStatus are optional. The rest of elements
            for this type of ConfirmationStatus are ignored.

        reject
            This portion of the line item is rejected.

            This type is allowed in documents with overall
            (ConfirmationHeader) types "allDetail", "detail" or "except".
        requestToPay
            A requestToPay is being asked about this portion of the line
            item. Request-to-pay will initiate a request to the financial
            institution to begin the settlement process of the portion of
            the line item.

            This type is allowed in documents with overall request
            (ConfirmationHeader) type "requestToPay".
        unknown
            The status of this portion of the line item is not known at
            the time of this confirmation.  This line item status may
            provide a "placeholder" while the supplier does further
            research.  Update confirmations may also reset the status of a
            line item portion to "unknown" when an earlier confirmation
            (incorrectly) accepted or rejected that portion.

            This type is allowed in documents with overall
            (ConfirmationHeader) types "allDetail", "detail" or "except".
    shipmentDate
        The date and time this shipment is expected to leave the supplier.
        A ConfirmationStatus element should include this information if the
        type is "accept", "allDetail" or "detail".
    deliveryDate
        The date and time this shipment is expected to arrive.  Should not
        be included if the value matches that of the requestedDeliveryDate
        attribute (if any) in the corresponding OrderRequest document.
        Otherwise, a ConfirmationStatus element should include this
        information if its type is "accept", "allDetail" or "detail".

    Request to add shipment information to the data known about an order at
    the receiving server.

    Shipments with multiple responsible carriers may be described in one of
    two ways:
    1. A single carrier (or third-party logistics provider) creates a
       tracking identifier that may be used to retrieve information about
       the entire trip.  Suppliers send such information in a single
       ShipControl element.  Optionally, they may use Route elements to
       describe lower-level carriers.
    2. Separate tracking numbers are required for each segment.  Suppliers
       send such information with one ShipControl element per segment.

    ShipControl elements must appear in the order the shipment will travel.
    The first such element must not have an explicit starting date (the
    ShipControl@startDate attribute must not be present) and that carrier's
    control must begin at the shipment's origination time
    (ShipNoticeHeader@shipmentDate attribute value).  All later ShipControl
    elements must have increasing (later) starting dates
    (ShipControl@startDate attribute value).

    ShipNoticePortion elements may appear in any order.  A particular order
    (ShipNoticePortion/OrderReference/DocumentReference@payloadID attribute
    value) must not appear more than once in a ShipNoticeRequest element.

    Note: Many elements and attributes in the ShipNoticeRequest and
    ShipNoticeHeader elements are optional only for the operation="delete"
    case.  For other operations, one or more ShipControl and
    ShipNoticePortion elements must appear in a ShipNoticeRequest element.
-->
<!ELEMENT ShipNoticeRequest
    (ShipNoticeHeader, ShipControl*, ShipNoticePortion*)>

<!--
    Information about this ship notice that's common to all contained
    items.

    One or more ServiceLevel elements must appear in all ShipNoticeRequest
    documents except when operation="delete" is specified.  Each
    ServiceLevel must contain a single string corresponding to the level of
    service (such as "overnight") provided by the carrier for this
    shipment.  When multiple ServiceLevel elements appear, all must
    describe the same level of service in different languages or locales.
    (No two ServiceLevel elements may have the same xml:lang attribute.)
    Elements in such a list may appear in any order.

    The contained DocumentReference element may appear in a document only
    when the operation is "update" or "delete".  In that case, the
    DocumentReference is required and it must reference the most recent
    ShipNoticeRequest document for this particular ship notice (also
    indicated by a common shipmentID).  For example when a ship notice is
    created, updated and then updated again, the final document must
    contain a DocumentReference referring to the previous ShipNoticeRequest
    with operation="update".  That document must, in turn, refer to the
    original (operation="new") ShipNoticeRequest document.

    Contact roles may usefully include: technicalSupport, customerService,
    sales, shipFrom (starting point for this shipment), shipTo (should echo
    the ShipTo element from the OrderRequest documents), buyerCorporate
    (details the supplier has about the buying organization) and
    supplierCorporate.  It is not generally necessary to copy information
    from the various OrderRequest documents: The Contact element should be
    used primarily to add information to that known about an order.

    Elements in the Contact list may appear in any order.  A contact role
    (Contact@role attribute value) must not appear more than once within a
    ShipNoticeHeader element.

    Elements in the Hazard list may appear in any order.  The same hazard
    should not be listed more than once in a ShipNoticeHeader.  Each hazard
    listed at this level (in a ShipNoticeHeader element) should apply to
    the entire shipment or all items contained in this shipment.  A
    ShipNoticeRequest for a single line item should not include Hazard
    elements in the ShipNoticeItem element.

    The Comments element list may contain additional information about the
    shipment.  In this context (the ShipNoticeHeader), that information
    must be common to all contained items and routes.  All such data must
    be intended for human use. This information could also include a reason 
    for shipment to indicate rush orders for example. 

    The Comments element list may also contain structured comments with 
    type as "ReasonForShipment" to describe any specific reason for this shipment
    and with type as "TransitDirection" to specify transit direction.
    Reason for shipment is typically specified with replace/partial shipments to
    let the buyer know about the need of the shipment.
    
    Elements in the Comments list may appear in any order.  The xml:lang
    attribute may have the same value in multiple Comments elements in the
    list.  The set of Comments with a particular xml:lang value should
    contain similar content to that for any other xml:lang value present in
    the list.

    On the other hand, the Extrinsic element list may be used to insert
    additional data about the shipment for application consumption.  These
    elements may include pre-defined keywords and values affecting workflow
    in the receiving system.

    Elements in the Extrinsic list may appear in any order.  An extrinsic
    type (Extrinsic@name attribute value) must not appear more than once
    within a ShipNoticeHeader element.  A type may not be mentioned both in
    this list and in a particular ShipControl or ShipNoticePortion element.
    (The ShipNoticeHeader must not contain a default extrinsic value
    overridden at either lower level.)

    shipmentID
        An identifier for this particular shipment assigned by the
        supplier.  A user-visible and secondary (to the payloadID attribute
        of the cXML element) identifier for this document.  This value does
        not vary as a particular ship notice is updated.  That is,
        operation="update" or operation="delete" documents describing the
        same shipment must share a shipmentID with the original
        operation="new" ShipNoticeRequest.
    operation
        The (optional) operational mode of ship notice document.  Defaults
        to "new".

        An "update" ship notice allows a supplier to correct an error in a
        ship notice or to add additional information learned later.  In
        either case, an "update" document must be complete: All data from
        the original should be discarded by the recipient.

        A "delete" ship notice removes the changes described in the
        previous ShipNoticeRequest (either operation="new" or a previous
        update) from the state of the shipment.  This operation should be
        used only when the supplier discards a planned shipment or
        incorrectly sends a ShipNoticeRequest about a shipment that will
        not take place.

        An "update" or "delete" ship notice must have the same shipmentID
        as the previous version of the notice.  This provides an
        unambiguous and direct connection between all versions of the ship
        notice.

        If the operation is not "new" (explicitly or by default), the
        ShipNoticeRequest must also include a DocumentReference element in
        the ShipNoticeHeader.  (See above for more information on this
        element.)  This effectively sequences multiple versions of a ship
        notice.
    noticeDate
        The date and time this ship notice was created.
    shipmentDate
        The date and time this shipment left the supplier.  This attribute
        must appear in all ShipNoticeRequest documents except when
        operation="delete" is specified. This can be an actual or an estimated 
        date based on shipmentType attribute.
    deliveryDate
        The date and time this shipment is expected to arrive.  While this
        value may default to the requestedDeliveryDate of a single order,
        that attribute is optional in an OrderRequest document and the
        ShipNoticeRequest may refer to multiple OrderRequest documents.
        This attribute must appear in all ShipNoticeRequest documents
        except when operation="delete" is specified. This can be an actual 
        or an estimated date based on shipmentType attribute.
    shipmentType
        The type of this shipment. The value can be "actual" or "planned"
        depending on whether this notice is being created for actual shipment
        or an estimated one. This attribute also decides whether shipmentDate 
        and deliveryDate attributes hold actual or estimated dates.
    fulfillmentType
        The type of fulfillment, for which this shipment notice is created.
        The value of this attribute can be "partial" if all the items are
        not being shipped and "complete" if the whole order is being shipped.
    requestedDeliveryDate
        The date on which the items were requested to be delivered.

    Carrier responsible for some portion of the shipment.  The shipment
    will be tracked using the identifiers provided at this level.  Those
    identifiers should be valid from the startDate of one ShipControl
    element or the shipment's shipmentDate until the startDate of the next.

    The CarrierIdentifier list may include multiple identifiers for the
    same carrier.  Elements in this list may appear in any order.  A
    particular identification domain (CarrierIdentifier@domain attribute
    value) must not appear more than once in a ShipControl element.  The
    identification provided by all elements of the CarrierIdentifier list
    must correspond to the same company.

    If present, Route elements must be in the order the shipment will
    travel.

    The only Contact roles likely to be sensible in this element are
    "carrierCorporate" (details the contact information the supplier has
    about the carrier organization) and "shipFrom".  A Contact element with
    role "shipFrom" must appear in all ShipControl elements after the
    first.  This role must not appear in the first ShipControl element
    since it would duplicate that role in the overall ShipNoticeHeader
    element.  Since a Contact with role "shipTo" would always duplicate
    information in the following ShipControl element or that role in the
    ShipNoticeHeader, such a Contact must not appear in this element.  In
    essence, control passes from one carrier to another at a particular
    location and (estimated) time.

    Elements in the Contact list may appear in any order.  A contact role
    (Contact@role attribute value) must not appear more than once within a
    ShipControl element.

    The Comments element list may contain additional information about the
    shipment while under the control of this carrier.  In this context (the
    ShipControl element), that information must be common to all contained
    routes or make it clear which Route is affected.  All such data must be
    intended for human use.

    Elements in the Comments list may appear in any order.  The xml:lang
    attribute may have the same value in multiple Comments elements in the
    list.  The set of Comments with a particular xml:lang value should
    contain similar content to that for any other xml:lang value present in
    the list.

    On the other hand, the Extrinsic element list may be used to insert
    additional data about this carrier or their period of responsibility
    for application consumption.  These elements may include pre-defined
    keywords and values affecting workflow in the receiving system.

    Elements in the Extrinsic list may appear in any order.  An extrinsic
    type (Extrinsic@name attribute value) must not appear more than once
    within a ShipControl element.  A type may not be mentioned both in this
    list and in the overall ShipNoticeHeader element.  (The
    ShipNoticeHeader must not contain a default extrinsic value overridden
    at this lower level.)

    startDate
        The date and time this shipment started this part of the route.
        Required for all ShipControl elements after the first.  This
        attribute must not appear in the first ShipControl element since it
        would duplicate the ShipNoticeHeader's shipmentDate attribute.

<!--
    Purchase order and item data.  Answers the question: What's coming in
    this shipment?

    A particular OrderRequest (via the OrderReference element) must not be
    mentioned in more than one ShipNoticePortion element.  While multiple
    shipments may be sent for one order, a ship notice must mention each
    order only once.

    MasterAgreementReference or MasterAgreementIDInfo can be used to identify 
    the corresponding scheduling agreement if the ship notice is generated
    from a scheduling agreement release.

    Any Contact elements provided at this level describe contacts specific
    to this order.  The ShipNoticeHeader description mentions roles
    appropriate at this level as well, though shipFrom, shipTo,
    buyerCorporate and supplierCorporate information should not vary at
    this level.  A particular Contact role must not appear in both the
    ShipNoticePortion and ShipNoticeHeader elements.  Therefore, roles such
    as technicalSupport, customerService and sales are most appropriate
    within the ShipNoticePortion.

    Elements in the Contact list may appear in any order.  A contact role
    (Contact@role attribute value) must not appear more than once within a
    ShipNoticePortion element.

    The Comments element list may contain additional information about the
    order in this shipment.  In this context (the ShipNoticePortion
    element), that information must be common to all contained items or
    make it clear which ShipNoticeItem is affected.  All such data must be
    intended for human use.

    Elements in the Comments list may appear in any order.  The xml:lang
    attribute may have the same value in multiple Comments elements in the
    list.  The set of Comments with a particular xml:lang value should
    contain similar content to that for any other xml:lang value present in
    the list.

    On the other hand, the Extrinsic element list may be used to insert
    additional data about this order for application consumption.  These
    elements may include pre-defined keywords and values affecting workflow
    in the receiving system.

    Elements in the Extrinsic list may appear in any order.  An extrinsic
    type (Extrinsic@name attribute value) must not appear more than once
    within a ShipNoticePortion element.  A type may not be mentioned both
    in this list and in the overall ShipNoticeHeader element.  (The
    ShipNoticeHeader must not contain a default extrinsic value overridden
    at this lower level.)

    If a ShipNoticePortion element contains no ShipNoticeItem elements, the
    entire referenced order is included in the shipment.  Note: This
    simplifying option prevents inclusion of hazard and packaging
    information.

    (OrderReference, (MasterAgreementReference | MasterAgreementIDInfo)?,  Contact*, Comments*, Extrinsic*, ShipNoticeItem*)>

<!--
    Portion of a specific line item that is part of this shipment.

    A line item from an order must not be mentioned in more than one
    ShipNoticeItem element.  While additional quantities of an item may be
    shipped separately, a single ship notice must describe each item only
    once.

    Elements in the Hazard list may appear in any order.  The same hazard
    should not be listed more than once in a ShipNoticeItem.  Each hazard
    listed at this level (in a ShipNoticeItem element) must apply to this
    specific line item.  A ShipNoticeRequest for a single line item should
    not include Hazard elements in the ShipNoticeItem element.
    
    ShipNoticeItemDetail contains detailed information about an item. All the data that
    a user would want to see about an item instead of the bare essentials.
    In a ship notice the item details are inherited from the purchase order 
    that is referenced. For ship notices without order reference the item details 
    can be retrieved from this section.

    Batch
    An element carrying batch information for material or goods  produced
    in a single manufacturing run.

    SupplierBatchID
        SupplierBatch is the batch ID provided by the supplier at the line item quantity level 
        to identify  the batch in which the item or the product was produced. The batch id is helpful in tracebility.
        Batch numbers (also call "lot number", "variant") are used in several industries to uniquely identify  items produced together.

    ComponentConsumptionDetails
        Contains detailed information about consumption of components in the manufacturing of final product.

    quantity
        Number of this line item which was shipped.  Expressed in the units
        given in the UnitOfMeasure element.

<!--
    A Credential Message Authentication Code (MAC).  This is used in
    situations where one party (the sender) must prove to another (the
    receiver) that it is authenticated by a shared secret with a third
    party trusted by both.

    The MAC should be computed by the trusted third party and
    transferred to the sender.  The MAC should be opaque to the sender
    (i.e., it should be secure and non-reversible).  The MAC should
    use as its inputs enough information to accomplish the following
    goals:

    (1) The MAC must prove to the receiver that it really originated
    with the trusted third party.  E.g., the MAC could use a shared
    secret between the receiver and the trusted third party as its
    secret key.

    (2) The MAC should be usable only by a certain sender.  E.g., the
    MAC could authenticate an identifier for the sending organization.

    (3) The MAC should prove that the sender is authorized to send on
    behalf of the From organization.  E.g., the MAC could authenticate
    an identifier for the From organization.

    (4) The MAC should limit the risk of the MAC being compromised and
    used to impersonate the sender by another party communicating with
    the receiver.  E.g., the MAC could authenticate an expiration date
    or sequence number.

    type
        An implementation-dependent identifier for the exact data
        being authenticated and the method in which it is formatted
        for authentication.  Currently the only supported value is

        algorithm used on the data.  Currently the only supported
        value is "HMAC-SHA1-96".
