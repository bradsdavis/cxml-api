    Common to most variants of the PunchOut transaction set.  Defined here
    to be easily shared between multiple DTD files without requiring
    inclusion of Transaction.mod in all of them.

    All of the PunchOut transaction sets include an originating Request
    (ProviderSetupRequest for example), relatively simple Response
    (PunchOutSetupResponse for example) and final Message
    (ProviderDoneMessage or PunchOutOrderMessage).  The Request and
    Response comprise a back-end transaction between two cooperating
    applications that wish to extend an interactive session from one to the
    other.  The Request provides the destination application with
    authentication, identification and other setup information.  The
    Response provides the originating application with a unique starting
    location for the interactive (HTML) session at the destination system.

    After receiving a Response of this type, the originating application
    redirects the user's browser to the provided location.  (For some
    non-HTML applications, opening a new browser window at that location
    may be more appropriate.)  The destination system eventually provides
    an HTML form to the user's browser.  This form submits the final
    Message to close the remote session, return that user to the
    originating application and carry any required information back to the
    originating application.

<!--
    OriginatorCookie - Identification of a specific PunchOut session.  Used

    (defined in Transaction.mod) is of type ANY.  That does not seem

    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.


    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document.  Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections.  This would appear as:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities.  This might be a bit harder for humans to read.  For example:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

	the sum of the item level subtotals. The total is used to indicate the maximum
	commitment with the supplier. The total will not add upto the individual item
	level sub total or MaxAmounts. The item level MaxAmounts should not exceed the
	header level total. If the item level MaxAmount is not specified it is assumed
	that the Item level maximum amount is the same as the Total.

    The contained DocumentReference element would appear in a document only
    when the type is "update" or "delete".  In that case, the
    DocumentReference would reference the most recent OrderRequest document
    for the order.  For example when an order is created, updated and then
    deleted, the final document should contain a DocumentReference
    referring to the OrderRequest with type="update".  That document would,
    in turn, refer to the original (type="new") OrderRequest document.

    A Credential Message Authentication Code (MAC).  This is used in

    receiver) that it is authenticated by a shared secret with a third
    party trusted by both.

    The MAC should be computed by the trusted third party and
    transferred to the sender.  The MAC should be opaque to the sender
    (i.e., it should be secure and non-reversible).  The MAC should
    use as its inputs enough information to accomplish the following
    goals:

    (1) The MAC must prove to the receiver that it really originated
    with the trusted third party.  E.g., the MAC could use a shared
    secret between the receiver and the trusted third party as its
    secret key.

    (2) The MAC should be usable only by a certain sender.  E.g., the
    MAC could authenticate an identifier for the sending organization.

    (3) The MAC should prove that the sender is authorized to send on
    behalf of the From organization.  E.g., the MAC could authenticate
    an identifier for the From organization.

    (4) The MAC should limit the risk of the MAC being compromised and
    used to impersonate the sender by another party communicating with
    the receiver.  E.g., the MAC could authenticate an expiration date
    or sequence number.

    type
        An implementation-dependent identifier for the exact data
        being authenticated and the method in which it is formatted
        for authentication.  Currently the only supported value is
        "FromSenderCredentials".

        value is "HMAC-SHA1-96".

    AuthRequest

    An AuthRequest is used when one party (the "receiver") receives
    credentials from another party (the "principal") and the receiver
    needs a trusted third party to validate the credentials.  The
    receiver should enclose the credentials in an AuthRequest and send
    them to the trusted third party for validation.

    If the principal attempts to authenticate by revealing the shared
    secret between itself and the trusted third party (not
    recommended), the receiver should forward the credentials as they
    were received, including the shared secret.

    If the principal attempts to authenticate through a client
    certificate (recommended), the receiver should forward the
    credentials as well as an X509Data element containing an
    X509IssuerSerial element describing the certificate used by the
    principal (the receiver normally obtains this information from its
    webserver or SSL/TLS implementation).

    If the supplied credential is invalid, the trusted third party
    should respond with an empty cXML response of status 403
    (Forbidden).  If the supplied credential is valid, the trusted
    third party should respond with an AuthResponse that contains the
    valid credentials.

<!--
    Defines the party involved in the payment, including Payer of this
    payment (payer), Payee of this payment (payee),
    Payer's bank (originatingBank), Payee's bank (receivingBank),
    Payer's Correspondent Bank, Payee's Correspondent Bank, Intermediary Bank, etc

    Contact
        Contact information of the payment partner.  Allowed contact
        roles include payer, payee, originatingBank, receivingBank,
        originatingCorrespondentBank, receivingCorrespondent, 
        receivingCorrespondentBank, intermediaryBank, and remitTo.

        Contact elements with role 'payer' and 'payee' are always
        required. If the payment method indicates a bank transfer,
        then Contact elements with role 'originatingBank' and
        'receivingBank' are required.

        If the contact role is 'remitTo', it would contain contact
        information of the remittance address. For this role, the
        IdReference and PCard elements may be absent.

    IdReference
        Partner reference ID, including bank account identification,
        bank identification, and optionally bank branch identification.

        IdReference is mandatory for all transactions that involve
        electronic payments. It is optional only for non-electronic
        forms of payments, such as, 'check', 'draft' etc.

        The bank account identification is specified as follows:
            bankAccountID   : Domestic account number
            ibanID          : IBAN ID (International Bank Account Number) as
                              specified in ISO 13616.

        The bank identification is specified as follows:
            abaRoutingNumber: ABA (American Banking Association)
                              Routing Number)
            swiftID         : SWIFT ID (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
                              Telecommunications)
            chipsID         : CHIPS ID (Clearing House Interbank Payment System)
            isoBicID        : ISO BIC ID (Bank Identifier Code) as specified
                              in ISO 9362.
                              The Bank Identifier Code (BIC) is a
                              universal method of identifying
                              financial institutions. The BIC consists
                              of 8 or 11 characters, comprising a bank
                              code (4 characters), a country code (2
                              characters), a location code (2
                              characters) and an optional branch code
                              (3 characters).

            bankNationalID : If none of the above bank identification
                             methods are applicable, then use this to
                             specify national clearing codes that are
                             specific to a country. This identification
                             if used, should uniquely identify
                             the bank within the country specified in the
                             Contact.
	
	    
        The bank branch identification, if necessary, is specified as follows:
            bankBranchID    : The bank branch ID

        The following table illustrates some valid combinations of
        Contact and IdReference domains:

        behaves as the payee for receiving correspondent bank.  We need this new role because 
        in the wire transfer case, the receiving party could have up to two banks: beneficiary 
        and corresponding banks.  Hence,  payee role is needed to contain the information about 
        beneficiary bank account and receivingBank role is needed to contain the information
